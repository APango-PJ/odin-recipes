            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup + 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley divided</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pound deli sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Lay eggplant slices out onto prepared baking sheets into a single layer. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes, turning halfway through.</li>  
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage or ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in fresh basil, oregano, ½ teaspoon salt, pepper, and ¼ cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes (or up to 4 hours).</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, ½ teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan. To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 6 eggplant slices on top to cover the bottom of the pan. Spread with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with ¼ of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of eggplant, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the eggplant. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
