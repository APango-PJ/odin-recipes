        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ready to bake pizza dough</li>
            <li>3/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked chicken shredded or small cubes</li>
            <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bacon cooked and crumbled</li>
            <li>1/2 small red onion finely sliced</li>
            <li>Freshly chopped cilantro optional, garnishing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Using a 12-14 inch cast iron skillet, grease the bottom of it and then lay the prepared dough into it making the edges come up to the rim of the pan. Spread barbecue sauce in an even layer onto the dough, leaving a small edge for the crust. </li>
            <li>Spread mozzarella cheese onto the sauced dough, sprinkle chicken, onion, and bacon crumbles on top and then top with cheddar cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake, covered loosely with foil, in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and starting to brown and the dough is cooked. Cook longer if needed to ensure dough is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and garnish with cilantro. Slice and serve hot. </li>
        
        </ol>
